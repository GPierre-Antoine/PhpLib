# Php Library for multiple project.
###### *Makes use of PSR interfaces*

This is a PHP Library project, allowing to avoid redoing boilerplate code.

This library tends to follow the PSR Guidelines : https://www.php-fig.org/

As of today (July the 21st, 2018), the page advertises for 3 major sections :

- Autoloading (PSR-4)
- Interfaces (PSR-3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16)
- Coding styles (PSR-1, 2)

This code try to follows the PSR recommendations except for PSR-2 5.1 (namely putting curly braces on the same line as conditional statements), which :
- I have troubles reading
- Doesn't play well with my IDE's code autofolding
